   IANA Registrations for the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)
                draft-leiba-cbor-cddl-media-type-latest

Abstract

   When the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) was defined, media-
   type, content-format, CBOR tag, and a file name extension were not
   defined for CDDL Definitions in RFC 8610.  Correspondingly, this
   documents specifies a media type (including a file name extension), a
   content format, and a CBOR tag for CDDL Definitions as specified in
   RFC 8610.

1.  Introduction

   When the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) was defined, media-
   type, content-format, CBOR tag, and a file name extension were not
   defined for CDDL Definitions in [RFC8610].  Correspondingly, this
   documents specifies a media type (including a file name extension), a
   content format, and a CBOR tag for CDDL Definitions as specified in
   [RFC8610].

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Media Type

   IANA is requested to add "application/cddl" as a new media type for
   CDDL Definitions to the "Media Types" registry [IANA.media-types] in
   the Standards Tree [RFC6838]:

            +======+==================+=======================+
            | Name | Template         | Reference             |
            +======+==================+=======================+
            | cddl | application/cddl | [RFC8610] and RFCthis |
            +------+------------------+-----------------------+

                          Table 1: CDDL Media Type

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  cddl

   Required parameters:  N/A

   Optional parameters:  N/A

   Encoding considerations:  text

   Security considerations:  See Security Considerations in RFC 8610.

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  RFCthis

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that need to
      describe the structure of data in representation formats such as
      CBOR and JSON.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  N/A

   Additional information:  Deprecated alias names for this type:i  N/A

                            Magic number(s):  N/A

                            File extension(s):  cddl

                            Macintosh file type code(s):  N/A

   Person/email address to contact for further information:  CBOR WG
      mailing list (cbor@ietf.org)

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restriction on usage:  none

   Author:  See Author's Addresses section

   Change controller  IETF

   Provisional registration:  no

2.2.  CoAP Content Format

   IANA is requested to assign a Content-Format ID for CDDL Definitions
   in the "CoAP Content-Formats" registry, within the "Constrained
   RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry group
   [IANA.core-parameters]:

   +==================+================+======+=======================+
   | Content-Type     | Content Coding | ID   | Reference             |
   +==================+================+======+=======================+
   | application/cddl | -              | TBD1 | [RFC8610] and RFCthis |
   +------------------+----------------+------+-----------------------+

                       Table 2: CDDL Content Format

   If possible, TBD1 should be assigned in the 256...9999 range.

2.3.  CBOR Tag

   IANA is requested to allocate a tag for CDDL Definitions in the "CBOR
   Tags" registry [IANA.cbor-tags], preferably with the specific value
   requested:

      +======+===========+=========================================+
      | Tag  | Data Item | Semantics                               |
      +======+===========+=========================================+
      | 4344 | text      | CDDL Definition as defined in [RFC8610] |
      +------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
